Computer science, the study of computation, offers students the challenge and excitement of a dynamically evolving science whose discoveries and applications affect every aspect of modern life. Computer science is a rich intellectual field where practitioners apply a computational approach to address a wide variety of interesting and challenging problems. Computer scientists are engaged in research in core areas of theoretical computer science, computer systems design, algorithms, and programming languages, as well as more application-oriented areas such as databases, networking, and informatics.

The Department of Computer and Information Science (CIS) is committed to a strong research program and a rewarding educational experience for undergraduate and graduate students.

The department offers instruction and opportunities for research in the following areas:

theoretical computer science (computational complexity, models of computation, algorithm design)
computational science
operating systems, parallel processing, distributed systems, performance evaluation
human-computer interaction, visualization
computer security
software engineering
networking
databases and data mining
programming languages and compilers
artificial intelligence
The department offers bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees; in addition, two undergraduate minors and a selection of service courses are offered for students who want introductory exposure to computers and computer applications. The computer science programs at the university are continually evolving as the discipline matures and as students’ needs change.

Facilities
The Department of Computer and Information Science is housed in Deschutes Hall, which holds faculty and graduate student offices and extensive laboratory space for research and instruction.

Undergraduate majors may use campus computing labs staffed by CIS undergraduate tutors and lab assistants. Undergraduate majors taking upper-division courses and graduate students share a collaborative computing lab for the exclusive use of CIS students. Graduate and undergraduate students engaged in active research also have access to the computing facilities of the associated research lab.

The cognitive modeling and eye-tracking laboratory features multiple Eyegaze eye trackers and a Tobii T60 eye tracker, used to collect and analyze the eye movements people make during human-computer interactions, and to develop eye-controlled user interfaces for people with disabilities. The lab also features a VRSonic SoundSim Cube spatialized audio server used to explore three-dimensional sound perception.

Research in high-performance computing and computational science is supported by resources shared among the department, the Computational Science Institute, and the Neuroinformatics Center. In addition, the University of Oregon, through a Major Research Instrumentation Program grant from the National Science Foundation, has created a large-scale computational and storage resource to support multidisciplinary scientific research. The Applied Computational Instrument for Scientific Synthesis (ACISS) is a heterogenous platform managed as a cloud system for computational science, informatics, and data science.

To complement these facilities, the CIS department has a visualization lab with a tiled LCD display wall, 3-D stereo, and a high-definition tiled rear-projection system.

The advanced integration and mining laboratory fosters research on finding useful patterns from the mountain of data on biology, health, medicine, neuroscience, physiology, and social networks and on integrating data from structurally and semantically heterogeneous resources such as databases, the World Wide Web, and the Semantic Web.

The multimedia and internetworking research laboratory features an array of high-end servers and mass storages for development and testing of new network protocols as well as network measurement.

The network security laboratory features hardware and software facilities devoted to simulation of malicious network software (including Internet worms and phishing) and experimentation on defense countermeasures (such as Internet routing security).

The systems infrastructure and information security laboratory contains workstations and devices for embedded systems design and analysis, hardware for mobile computing and smartphone security research, and high-performance servers and storage arrays for simulation and bare-metal performance analysis of network, systems, and cloud research.

The ubiquitous computing laboratory uses a mix of custom-designed and commercial hardware to study the application of assistive software to everyday living. Researchers are particularly interested in the design of software for those with impairments that limit their use of commercial, off-the-shelf software.

In addition, the university is a member of Internet2, a high-speed network connecting major research institutions.

Careers
The undergraduate program is designed to prepare students for professional careers or graduate study. The field of computer science, which has become increasingly interdisciplinary over the past decade, offers a rich array of opportunities in fields as disparate as medicine, manufacturing, and the media as well as the computer industry.

Graduates come away with confidence that they can specify, design, and build large software systems; analyze the effectiveness of computing techniques for a specific problem; and work effectively in problem-solving teams. The master of arts (MA) and master of science (MS) degree programs prepare students for higher-level positions in the areas described above as well as for teaching positions in community colleges. The PhD degree program trains students as scientists for advanced research in specialized areas of computer science and for teaching in universities.
